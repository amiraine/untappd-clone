And along with other more hard-bitten local industries, they compete for the attentions of a creative and often otherwise-distracted workforce, dividing the hip and tattooed into brewers and roasters, barkeeps and baristas. Split Shot Espresso Milk Stout brings all that together, combining the talents of Elysian Brewing and Stumptown Coffee in a deliciously smooth, very Northwest beer. A complex bill of malts hold it all together--Northwest pale, C-15 and C-45 dextrine malts, Franco-Belges kiln coffee malt, Black, Roasted and Chocolate malts and flaked oats. Magnum hops add a touch of bitterness and milk sugar sweetens just a bit. Cold-infused Stumptown coffee provide an invigorating richness. Split Shot will warm and sustain through spring's cool evenings, and the combination of coffee and stout will definitely keep your attention.",

      "description" : "Three-time Large Brewpub of the Year at the Great American Beer Festival, Elysian Brewing Company operates four neighborhood restaurants and a production brewery in Seattle, Washington. Known both for classic styles and for flexibility and innovation, Elysian has brewed over 350 different recipes since opening in 1996. While Elysian’s brewers use a variety of unusual ingredients, they are seasonally notorious for their pumpkin beers. Each year Elysian hosts the Great Pumpkin Beer Festival, where dozens of different pumpkin beers are poured, some of them from giant pumpkins.  Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle’s most populous neigh- borhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks—a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened Tangletown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian TangleTown acted as the brewers’ test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian’s reputation as Seattle’s top brewpub. Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle’s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. Fields has since become an innovation center for our brewers where new beers are brewed each week on the 7bbl brew.",
