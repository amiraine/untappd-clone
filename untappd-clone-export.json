      "description" : "In Seattle, beer and coffee are like siblings, jealously dividing the day. It's a ticklish point as evening approaches, in fact, when the joys of the one give way to the other. And along with other more hard-bitten local industries, they compete for the attentions of a creative and often otherwise-distracted workforce, dividing the hip and tattooed into brewers and roasters, barkeeps and baristas. Split Shot Espresso Milk Stout brings all that together, combining the talents of Elysian Brewing and Stumptown Coffee in a deliciously smooth, very Northwest beer. A complex bill of malts hold it all together--Northwest pale, C-15 and C-45 dextrine malts, Franco-Belges kiln coffee malt, Black, Roasted and Chocolate malts and flaked oats. Magnum hops add a touch of bitterness and milk sugar sweetens just a bit. Cold-infused Stumptown coffee provide an invigorating richness. Split Shot will warm and sustain through spring's cool evenings, and the combination of coffee and stout will definitely keep your attention.",

The Dead Guy design proved so popular with consumers and especially Grateful Dead fans, that we made it the label for our Maierbock ale. Even though the association with the Grateful Dead band is pure coincidence, we have gratefully dedicated Dead Guy Ale to the Rogue in each of us.\n\nThe Dead Guy packaging remained unchanged for 25 years until 2017 when we updated the labels with our new design.
